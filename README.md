Epic: The Parent Master Module where this master topic can be divided into 

Multiple small 
Modules called User Story.
 Ex: Login Module, Data Module , 

Payment Module, Report Module.etc (Food Ordering App)




User Stories Creation: Create user stories for the features and 

functionalities of the netbanking 
app. The user stories should be written in a 

way that is easy to understand by both the developers 
and the stakeholders


Example

:
1. As a customer, I want to be able to transfer funds to another account 

securely and easily.
2. User able to login , search for food (Login and Data Module)




Backlog Creation: Create a backlog of tasks based on the user stories. The 

backlog should 
include all the tasks that need to be completed for the 

development Testing of the net banking app.

Example: Task 1: Develop the fund transfer functionality in the netbanking 

app.




Sprint Planning: Plan the sprints for the development of the net banking app. 

Determine the
length of the sprints(2 Weeks/2-4 Weeks), assign 

tasks/story/issue/bug to each sprint, and
 prioritize the tasks based on their 

importance.


Example


Sprint 1: Develop the login and account management functionality

Sprint 2: Develop the fund transfer functionality.

Sprint Review: Review the progress made during each sprint. Evaluate the 

completed tasks and
 determine if any changes need to be made to the project 

plan

1. Determine if any changes need to be made
to the project plan based on the 

completed tasks.




Scrum: Daily meetings happening with Top-Bottom roles and discussing their 

daily task (what

facedBlocked in development , Testing
 and Operations daily.




Sprint Retrospective: Conduct a retrospective at the end of each sprint to 

evaluate the
effectiveness of the process and identify areas for improvement.

Example: Conduct a retrospective at the end of Sprint 1. Evaluate the 

effectiveness of the process
and identify areas for improvement.


Release Planning: Plan the release of the net banking app. Determine the 

features and
functionalities that will be included in the first release and the 

timeline for the release.
